-- 0231 نبض الفريق — count EVERY action the person took, not just notes+moves
-- =========================================================================
-- Sky Light: creating a task or (re)assigning someone inside a task IS an
-- action the employee performed (Odoo records it as an authored chatter/log
-- entry). The goal of the pulse is "is this person actually doing things", so
-- these count too. Previously we counted only action_kind in ('note',
-- 'stage_move') and dropped 'created'/'tracking' (assignee/state/field edits).
--
-- Validated against Rwasem/Odoo: غادة authored 140 messages on tasks in June
-- (95 comment + 45 notification) — our all-kinds total is exactly 140, vs 130
-- under the old note+move-only filter. Counting all authored kinds = the true
-- Odoo activity.
--
-- Split stays two-way to match the team's mental model (stage moves vs the log):
--   moves  = stage_move
--   notes  = everything else authored (note + created + assignee/edits) — the
--            "log" side, which is where creation/assignment are recorded.
-- Only the authored CTE changes; workload (open/stalled/done) is untouched.
